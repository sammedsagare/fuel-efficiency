# Fuel Efficiency Calculator

This is a basic fuel efficiency calculator that helps you determine your vehicle's fuel efficiency. It calculates the mileage based on the readings of the current odometer, previous odometer, and fuel consumption.

## Usage

1. Enter the current odometer reading.
2. Enter the previous odometer reading.
3. Enter the amount of fuel consumed.
4. Click the "Calculate Mileage" button.

The result will be displayed in kilometers per liter ( km/l)

## Future Plans

I am planning to improve this calculator by adding a database to store and manage all fuel efficiency readings.
